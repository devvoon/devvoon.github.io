<p>이런 말, 원리가 있었어?<br />
새로운 것을 알게 되었을 때, 무릎을 탁치며 감탄하는 경우가 있는데 지금이 딱 그런 경우!<br />
그럼 이게 언제 적에 나온거지? 하고 알고나면 내 머리를 때려야해.<br />
왜 이제서야 알게 된거지?</p>

<p><strong>KISS : Keep it simple, stupid</strong><br />
KISS is an acronym for "Keep it simple, stupid" as a design principle noted by the U.S. Navy in 1960. The KISS principle states that most systems work best if they are kept simple rather than made complicated; therefore simplicity should be a key goal in design, and that unnecessary complexity should be avoided. The phrase has been associated with aircraft engineer Kelly Johnson.The term "KISS principle" was in popular use by 1970.Variations on the phrase include: "Keep it simple, silly", "keep it short and simple", "keep it simple and straightforward", "keep it small and simple" and "keep it stupid simple”.</p>

<p><strong>YAGNI : You aren't gonna need it</strong><br />
"You aren't gonna need it"(YAGNI) is a principle of extreme programming (XP) that states a programmer should not add functionality until deemed necessary. XP co-founder Ron Jeffries has written: "Always implement things when you actually need them, never when you just foresee that you need them.” Other forms of the phrase include "You aren't going to need it" and "You ain't gonna need it".</p>
